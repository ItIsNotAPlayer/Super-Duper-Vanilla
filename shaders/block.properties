## Double hashes should represent as comments
## Preprocessor control flows should always follow the rules for nesting

## Block ids should be flexible especially when it comes to modded blocks
## Block ids should not be duplicated even in other block ids
## Block ids should not use their legacy names (before 1.13)
## Block ids without assigned blocks are for user inputs
## Maximum block id is capped at 32767

## Currently used tags (Thanks SpaceEagle)
